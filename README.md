### 3. ## Automated Script for Easy PM2 Setup

To make it easier to start and manage your Node.js server with PM2, you can use the following script. This script will automatically start your Node.js application and set up PM2 to resurrect it after a system reboot.

### Script:

```powershell
# === Variables to adjust ===
$NodeExePath = "C:\Program Files\nodejs\node.exe"
$Pm2ResurrectCmd = "C:\Users\$env:USERNAME\AppData\Roaming\npm\node_modules\pm2\bin\pm2 resurrect"
$TaskName = "PM2_Resurrect"
$ServerJsPath = "D:\Code\Lyrically\Backend\server.js"  # """""""""""" Update with your actual path """"""""""""

# === Step 1: Start your Node.js server with PM2 ===
Write-Host "Starting your Node.js server with PM2..."
pm2 start $ServerJsPath

# === Step 2: Save current PM2 process list ===
Write-Host "Saving PM2 process list..."
pm2 save

# === Step 3: Create a Scheduled Task to resurrect PM2 on login ===
Write-Host "Creating Scheduled Task for PM2 resurrect..."
$Action = New-ScheduledTaskAction -Execute $NodeExePath -Argument $Pm2ResurrectCmd
$Trigger = New-ScheduledTaskTrigger -AtLogOn
$Principal = New-ScheduledTaskPrincipal -UserId $env:USERNAME -RunLevel Highest

Register-ScheduledTask -Action $Action -Trigger $Trigger -Principal $Principal -TaskName $TaskName -Description "Resurrect PM2 processes at user login" -Force

Write-Host "All done! Your Node.js server will now restart automatically after reboot."
```

### How to Run the Script:
1. Open **PowerShell** as Administrator.
2. paste the above command in the PowerShell
3. You're Good to go

This will:
- Start your Node.js app with PM2.
- Save the process list.
- Set up a scheduled task to restart the app after a system reboot.
